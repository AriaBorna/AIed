📅 WeekChecker - Odd/Even Week Calculator
🛠️ About WeekChecker
WeekChecker is a simple yet powerful program that determines whether a given date falls in an odd or even week in your university schedule.

This tool is useful for students who have alternating schedules based on the week number. Instead of manually counting weeks, simply input a date and let WeekChecker do the math for you! 🚀

📌 How It Works
The program operates based on the first academic week’s start date (e.g., the first Monday of the semester). Given any date, it calculates the number of weeks passed since that start date and tells you whether the current week is odd or even.
